      Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
      similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and
      countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
      GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What
      really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
      efficient rendering implementation, coupled with a sufficiently
      complete feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users.
